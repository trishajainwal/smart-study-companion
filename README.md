📚 Study Recommendation System

A smart study companion that recommends what to study based on your mood and focus level.

🌟 Overview

This project combines machine learning + web development to solve a simple but real problem:

"What should I study right now?"

Instead of choosing randomly, the system analyzes your current mood and focus level and suggests a subject using a trained ML model.
